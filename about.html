<p>My name is Steve Agalloco.  I live with my wife and our three children in Charlotte, NC. I'm a yankee transplant living in the south - the weather is nice and the people are too. I am Co-founder and VP of Enginering at <a href="https://tradier.com">Tradier</a>. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, golfing (when I have a chance), red wine, and the occasional single malt scotch.</p>

<p>A few things you may want to know about me:</p>

<p><strong>How do I pronounce Agalloco?</strong></p>

<p>Uh-gal-uh-co</p>

<p><strong>That's a mouthful.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, and that is not a question.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get in touch with you?</strong></p>

<p>The easiest way to get in touch with me is by email at <a
href="mailto:s&#116;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#46;ag&#97;l&#108;&#111;&#99;o&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;i&#108;.&#99;o&#109;">&#115;&#116;&#101;&#118;&#101;.&#97;&#103;&#97;&#108;loc&#111;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What does "before it was round" mean?</strong></p>

<p>Before it was round is a reference to the world pre-Christopher Columbus and the paradigm shift that took place afterwards. Prior to Columbus' discovery of North America, the earth was flat because we believed it to be. Hence: the earth was flat before it was round. I've always enjoyed thinking of things that way. That something is one thing, until something happens and then it isn't anymore. It's a simple way of thinking of the world (and yes, I'm aware that the Vikings likely discovered america well before Columbus).  Did you know that Columbus kept <a href="http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/columbus.htm">two logs of the journey</a>?  One with the actual distance calculated, and another to share with his crew. Fascinating.</p>

<p>For the past 5+ years I have been working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I enjoy contributing to open source software, notable projects include:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tweetstream/tweetstream">TweetStream</a>: I took over as maintainer from <a href="http://www.mbleigh.com/">Michael Bleigh</a> in 2011 and have since added support for OAuth, Site Streams, and many other features.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sferik/twitter">Twitter gem</a>: I am a member of the core team responsible for feature development and community support.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/stve/tophat">TopHat</a>: TopHat is a gem that I've used on nearly every Rails project I've worked on.  It allows you to easily include Facebook Open Graph and Twitter Card meta content in your Rails apps.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/stve/airbrake-api">Airbrake API</a>: The very first gem I published (when the service was called Hoptoad) for a now-defunkt side-project.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/stve/instapaper">Instapaper gem</a>: Instapaper is such a great service and if you are a subscriber you have access to the full API that this gem can interact with.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tweetstream/em-twitter">EM Twitter</a>: Probably the open source project I've logged the most hours on, EM-Twitter is the core behind TweetStream and enables full interaction with Twitter's Streaming API.</p>

<p>I've also contributed to: rails, rubygems, faraday_middleware, jsonpath, octokit, geocoder, rash, homebrew, and <a href="https://github.com/stve">many others</a>.
